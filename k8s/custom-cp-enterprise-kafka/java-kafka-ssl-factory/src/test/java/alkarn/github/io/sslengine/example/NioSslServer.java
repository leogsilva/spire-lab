/**
 * An SSL/TLS server, that will listen to a specific address and port and serve SSL/TLS connections
 * compatible with the protocol it applies.
 * <p/>
 * After initialization {@link NioSslServer#start()} should be called so the server starts to listen to
 * new connection requests. At this point, start is blocking, so, in order to be able to gracefully stop
 * the server, a {@link Runnable} containing a server object should be created. This runnable should
 * start the server in its run method and also provide a stop method, which will call {@link NioSslServer#stop()}.
 * </p>
 * NioSslServer makes use of Java NIO, and specifically listens to new connection requests with a {@link ServerSocketChannel}, which will
 * create new {@link SocketChannel}s and a {@link Selector} which serves all the connections in one thread.
